# Advanced Example 1: Multi-Agent Collaborative Gunpla Design with Memory & Iterative Feedback

In this demonstration, multiple agents collaborate in a custom Gunpla design project:
- **GroupChatManager:** Coordinates a design discussion.
- **Role-based Delegation:** Agents assume roles such as Concept Designer and Structural Engineer.
- **Function Calling:** Agents simulate external API integration for part compatibility.
- **Memory & Iterative Feedback:** A memory-enabled agent captures feedback to refine the design.
