## 2. Developing Azure Compute Solutions

### 2.1. Azure App Service
- **Overview**: PaaS offering for hosting web applications, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends.  
- **App Service Plans**:  
  - **Free/Shared**: Dev/test or small-scale usage.  
  - **Basic, Standard, Premium**: Dedicated VMs, auto-scaling, custom domains, SSL.  
  - **Isolated**: Dedicated environment, private endpoints, high security.  
- **Deployment Options**:  
  - Continuous integration via Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.  
  - Deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments (e.g., staging, production).  
- **Scaling**:  
  - Manual or autoscaling based on metrics (CPU, memory, request count).  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Use **deployment slots** for blue-green or canary releases.  
  - Implement **health checks** to ensure smooth rollouts.  
  - Store secrets in **Azure Key Vault** instead of app settings if possible.

### 2.2. Azure Functions (Serverless)
- **Overview**: Event-driven, serverless compute. Pay only for execution time (Consumption plan).  
- **Triggers and Bindings**:  
  - **Triggers**: HTTP requests, timers, Service Bus messages, Event Hub, Cosmos DB changes, etc.  
  - **Bindings**: Input/output to services like Azure Storage, Cosmos DB, etc.  
- **Hosting Plans**:  
  - **Consumption**: Automatically scales, pay per execution.  
  - **Premium**: Pre-warmed instances for always-available Functions.  
  - **Dedicated (App Service)**: Uses App Service plan with your own compute resources.  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Keep Functions stateless and idempotent if possible.  
  - Set appropriate **timeouts**.  
  - Use **Azure Monitor** or **Application Insights** for real-time logging and monitoring.

### 2.3. Azure Containers
#### 2.3.1. Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- **Overview**: Run containers without managing servers or clusters. Good for simple, isolated tasks and rapid deployment.  
- **Usage Scenarios**: Batch jobs, event-driven container workloads, sidecar containers for dev/test.

#### 2.3.2. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Overview**: Managed Kubernetes solution for running containerized workloads at scale.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Automated patching and upgrades.  
  - Autoscaling of pods (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and nodes (Cluster Autoscaler).  
  - Integration with Azure AD for cluster authentication.  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Use **pod security policies**, **network policies**, and **Azure Policy** for cluster governance.  
  - Leverage **Helm** for package management, **GitOps** for continuous delivery.  
  - Monitor with **Azure Monitor for containers**.

### 2.4. WebJobs and Background Tasks
- **Azure WebJobs**:  
  - Feature of Azure App Service to run background scripts or programs.  
  - Triggered or continuous modes.  
  - Still relevant but often replaced by Functions for more serverless scenarios.

## 3. Implementing Azure Security

### 3.1. Authentication and Authorization with Azure AD
- **Azure AD**: Central identity service in Azure.  
- **App Registrations**: Register apps to enable OAuth2/OpenID Connect flows.  
- **Access Tokens**: Used by clients to access protected resources (e.g., APIs).  
- **Refresh Tokens**: Obtain new access tokens without re-authentication.  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Implement **Microsoft Identity platform** libraries (MSAL) for secure token acquisition.  
  - Use **conditional access** and MFA for enhanced security.

### 3.2. Managed Identities
- **Overview**: Provides an automatically managed identity for Azure resources (e.g., VMs, App Service, Functions).  
- **Usage**: Access Azure resources without storing credentials in code.  
- **Two Types**:  
  - **System-assigned**: Tied to the lifecycle of the resource.  
  - **User-assigned**: Can be shared across resources.  

### 3.3. Azure Key Vault
- **Overview**: Securely store and manage secrets, keys, certificates.  
- **Integration**:  
  - With App Service app settings, Functions, AKS, etc.  
  - RBAC or Vault Access Policies to control who or what can access secrets.  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Rotate secrets regularly.  
  - Restrict direct access to the vault, use managed identities to retrieve secrets at runtime.

### 3.4. Securing APIs and Connections
- **API Security**:  
  - Use **Azure API Management** to secure, monitor, and publish APIs.  
  - Apply **policies** for rate limiting, IP restrictions, OAuth2.0 flows.  
- **Connection Strings and App Configurations**:  
  - Do not store secrets in plain text.  
  - Use Key Vault references or managed identities to fetch secrets.
